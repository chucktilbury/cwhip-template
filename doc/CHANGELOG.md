# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Discover the whole installed SDK prefix from the top-level `sdk_prefix`
  string in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cwhip/settings.toml` (or
  `$HOME/.config/cwhip/settings.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset/empty)
  in both CMake and setup.
  Preserve precedence: non-empty `CWHIP_SDK` > settings > normal CMake
  discovery. Parse TOML with Python 3.11+ without evaluating or modifying
  user settings, and reject invalid selections without falling back.
- Export a settings-selected SDK to the setup shell and add regression
  coverage for discovery precedence, TOML paths, errors, and shell handoff.
- Add the standard MIT license.
- Add a CWhip hello-world starter with a project setup script and interactive
  development shell.
- Configure CMake to discover an installed CWhip 0.0.1 SDK, support explicit
  SDK selection, and place application/native outputs in configurable
  project directories.
- Document SDK selection, building, output customization, and project-shell
  commands.

The starter requires a CWhip SDK that provides configurable application
output directories. SDKs without the `Cwhip_APPLICATION_OUTPUT_DIRECTORIES`
capability are rejected during configuration.
